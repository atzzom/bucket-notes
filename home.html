  <code><a href="navigation.html">line one<span class="blinking-cursor">|</span></a></code>

  <p class="subtitle">elements of web development</p>

  <p>Is necessary to set up the distance from the top of the screen to this element in such a way that doesn't depend on the screen size, in other words, in this case is set to 300 px but must be set up in such a way that regardless the screen it is diplayed it is always at the center of it.</p>

  <p>Apparently is solved setting the property to: <em>margin-top: 25%;</em> but with: <em>padding-top: 25%;</em>the result is almost the same.</p>

  <p>Also select another typography for the subtitle, and make the cursor blink via CSS.</p>
