  <h2>Semantics overview</h2>

    <p>As we start building websites, is necessary to know which type of element is best to display an specific type of content, additionally, is very useful to know how elements are displayed on a web page.</p>

    <p>Semantics is the meaning of a word from its name. Within HTML, is the practice to give the document the proper meaning and structure by using the adequate element. Semantic content works in the same way, describes its <em>meaning</em> and <em>value</em> regardless the style or appearance of that content. Semantic content has several benefits related with make easier for people, developers, computers, search engines, etc. to understand and manage the content on a web page as it shows clearly what piece of content is about. Before go deeper in this concepts, the elements <code>&#60;div&#62;</code> and <code>&#60;spans&#62;</code> -<i>that contradictorily don't hold any semantic value, as they exist only for styling purposes</i>- are going to be studied.</p>

  <h2>Identifying divisions & spans</h2>

    <p>This two elements do not have any specific meaning, that's why they don't hold any semantic value, they act as containers only for styling purposes. In order to see more clear the difference of the elements with semantic value from the ones who don't have any semantic value, let's see an example: Paragraphs (<code>&#60;p&#62;</code>) have semantic value as whatever the content they have (or are expected to have) is going to be interpreted as a paragraph (words), therefore, no other value is expected for this element (e.g. no images, video, media, etc. is expected); but on the other hand, an element as a <code>&#60;div&#62;</code> and a <code>&#60;spans&#62;</code> doesn't have this difference, basically, any type of content can be expected inside them (they are simply containers).</p>

    <p>Although they are part of the HTML and not CSS, these elements are extremely valuable when building a website, as they give us the ability to apply targeted styles to a contained set of content. A <code>&#60;div&#62;</code> is a block-level element that encloses or identify large groupings of content, helping to build a page layout and design. On the other hand an <code>&#60;span&#62;</code> is an inline-level element used to identify smaller groups of text within a block level element.</p>

    <p>Is common to see <code>&#60;div&#62;</code> and <code>&#60;spans&#62;</code> with <code>class</code> and <code>id</code> attributes with the purpose of aiding in the application of an style, however, is necessary to keep in mind that the value of these attributes ideally must refer to the content or nature of the element rather than its apperance or style.</p>

    <p>For example, if we have a <code>&#60;div&#62;</code> with an orange background that contains social media links, our first thought might be to give the <code>&#60;div&#62;</code> a <code>class</code> value of <code>orange</code>. What happens if that orange background is later changed to blue? Having a <code>class</code> value of <code>orange</code> no longer makes sense. A more sensible choice for a <code>class</code> value would be <code>social</code>, as it pertains to the contents of the <code>&#60;div&#62;</code>, not the style.</p>

<!-- 16.10.28 --------------------------------------------- -->
    <p>The following is an example of the use of a division:<br>
    <code>&#60;!-- Division --&#62;<br>
    &#60;div class="social"&#62;<br>
    &#60;p&#62;I may be found on ... &#60;/p&#62;<br>
    &#60;p&#62;Additionally, I have a profile on ...&#60;/p&#62;<br>
    &#60;/div&#62;</code></p>

    <p><code>&#60;!-- Span --&#62;<br>
    &#60;p&#62;Soon we'll be &#60;span class="tooltip"&#62;writing HTML &#60;/span&#62; with the best of them&#60;/p&#62;</code></p>

  <h2>Using text-based elements</h2>

    <p>This kind of elements are thought to contain text, they also can be formatted. On the other hand, although there are other types of media or content (images, video, etc.) text is predominant, this type of elmentes can be italized and/or bolded.</p>

  <h2>Headings</h2>

    <p>Headings are block-line elements, they are ranked from <code>&#60;h1&#62; ... &#60;/h1&#62;</code> until <code>&#60;h6&#62; ... &#60;/h6&#62;</code> being the element <code>&#60;h1&#62;</code> the one of the biggest importance. These elements help to give structure to the document and also search engines to index and determine the content on a page.</p>

    <p>They should be used only when relevant to a page, i.e. when they hold semantic value, and should not be used to make text bold or big&mdash;there are better ways to do that.</p>

    <p>The following is an example of all the different heading levels and the resulting display on a web page:</p>

    <div class="embeded-note">
    <p><code>&#60;h1&#62;Heading level 1&#60;/h1&#62;<br>
    &#60;h2&#62;Heading level 2&#60;/h2&#62;<br>
    &#60;h3&#62;Heading level 3&#60;/h3&#62;<br>
    &#60;h4&#62;Heading level 4&#60;/h4&#62;<br>
    &#60;h5&#62;Heading level 5&#60;/h5&#62;<br>
    &#60;h6&#62;Heading level 6&#60;/h6&#62;<br></code></p>

    <p>
    <h1>Heading level 1</h1>
    Regular text.
      <h2>Heading level 2</h2><br>
      Regular text.
        <h3>Heading level 3</h3><br>
        Regular text.
          <h4>Heading level 4</h4><br>
          Regular text.
            <h5>Heading level 5</h5><br>
            Regular text.
              <h6>Heading level 6</h6>
              Regular text.
    </p>
</div>

  <h2>Bolding text</h2>

    <p>There is more than one way to bold text, namely, <code>&#60;b&#62;</code> (bold) and <code>&#60;strong&#62;</code>, althougth the final result is the same both hold different meaning, and are used in different situations.</p>

    <p>The <code>&#60;b&#62;</code> element is used when the content to be bolded is going to receive only a stylistically offset, but its relevance or meaning into the page is not high.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the <code>&#60;strong&#62;</code> element is used when the text bolded <strong>has</strong> a high relevance in the page. Examples of both cases are shown below:</p>

    <p><code>&#60;!-- Strong importance --&#62;<br>
    &#60;p&#62;&#60;strong&#62;Caution:&#60;/strong&#62; Falling rocks.&#60;/p&#62;</code></p>

    <p><code>&#60;!-- Stuylistically offset --&#62;<br>
    &#60;p&#62;This recipe calls for &#60;b&#62;bacon&#60;/b&#62; and &#60;b&#62;baconnaise&#60;/b&#62;.&#60;/p&#62;</code></p>

    <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Falling rocks.</p>

    <p>This recipe calls for <b>bacon</b> and <b>baconnaise</b>.</p>

<!-- 16.11.01 ---------------------------- -->
    <h3>Italicize text with emphasis</h3>

      <p>As with the elements for bold text, there are two different ways to italicize text, with slightly different semantic meaning.</p>

      <h4>Italicise without semantical meaning</h4>

      <p>When is desired italicize text only for stylistical purposes the best option is use the <code>&#60;i&#62;</code> element. This element adds/conveys <i>an alternative voice or tone</i>.</p>

      <h4>Italicize including semantical meaning</h4>

        <p>On the other hand, when the reason to italicize text is to add emphasis or semantical meaning to the text, the best option is use the <code>&#60;em&#62;</code> (emphasize), which is an in-line element. Here are examples of the usage of both elements for italicizing:</p>

        <p><code>&#60;!-- Stressed emphasis --&#62;<br>
        &#60;p&#62; I &#60;em&#62;love&#60;/em&#62; Chicago!</code></p>

        <p><code>&#60;!-- Alternative voice or tone --&#62;<br>
        &#60;p&#62;The name &#60;i&#62;Shay&#60;/i&#62; means a gift.&#60;/p&#62;</code></p>

        <p>These text-level elements are very useful for bringing the content to life. In addition to these, there are additional elements to provide structure to the document in a wider way, i.e. identifying groupings of content such as, headers, articles, footers, and so forth.</p>

  <h2>Building structure</h2>

    <p>Webpages, used to be built using divisions to separate content, the problem was that these divisions didn't add any semantical meaning, and didn't give an idea about the content they holded. Because of this, <em>structural based elements</em> where introduced to help build web documents in an easier and more coherent way. All of these, in addition to give meaning, improve the semantics of the document. Examples of those elements are: <code>&#60;header&#62;</code>, <code>&#60;nav&#62;</code>, <code>&#60;article&#62;</code>, <code>&#60;section&#62;</code>, <code>&#60;aside&#62;</code>, and <code>&#60;footer&#62;</code> elements.</p>

    <h3>Header</h3>

      <p>As its name implies it, the <code>&#60;header&#62;</code> element, is used to identify the top of the document, whether it is the body, article, section, or other page segment. In general, the <code>&#60;header&#62;</code> element may include a heading, introductory text, and even navigation.</p>

      <h4><code>&#60;header&#62;</code> <b>vs.</b> <code>&#60;head&#62;</code> <b>vs.</b> <code>&#60;h1&#62;</code> through <code>&#60;h6&#62;</code> elements.</h4>

        <p>Here are the main differences between these three elements:</p>

        <p><code>&#60;header&#62;</code><br>
        Falls within the <code>&#60;body&#62;</code> element. Outlines the heading of a <em>section/segment</em> of the page.</p>

        <p><code>&#60;head&#62;</code><br>
        Falls directly within the <code>&#60;html&#62;</code> element. Outlines metadata, the document title and links to external files.</p>

        <p>Headings elements <code>&#60;h1&#62;</code> through <code>&#60;h6&#62;</code><br>
        Falls within the body of the document, designate multiple levels of text.</p>

<!-- 16.11.07 -->

    <h3>Navigation</h3>

      <p>The <code>&#60;nav&#62;</code> element identifies a section of major navigational links on a page<em>(might be thought as a section/division as a header, footer, aside, etc, etc.?)</em>. This element should be reserved for primary navigation sections only, such as global navigation, a table on contents, previous/next links, or other noteworthy groups of navigational links. Commonly the <code>&#60;nav&#62;</code> element links to other pages within the same website or parts of the same page. However, miscellaneous one-off links should be wrapped within the <code>&#60;a&#62;</code> (anchor elment) and the anchor element only.</p>

    <h3>Article</h3>

      <p>Whenever there is self-contained or independent content that can be distributed or indepentently resused without confusion, such as, newspapers articles, blog post, user submitted content and the like, the <code>&#60;article&#62;</code>element should be used. A good criteria for its use can be, for instance, if the content within the <code>&#60;article&#62;</code> element were removed from the context of the page and placed, within an email or printed work, that content should still make sense.</p>

    <h3>Section</h3>

      <p>There are situations in which there are contents related although might be generic enough to be difficult assign a header for them, in this case, enclose it within a <code>&#60;section&#62;</code> element, as mentioned before, although might be generic in nature, this element help us identify the content as related. The <code>&#60;section&#62;</code> element is commonly used to break up and provide hierarchy to a page.</p>

      <h4><b>Deciding between</b> <code>&#60;article&#62;</code> <b>,</b> <code>&#60;section&#62;</code> <b>, or</b> <code>&#60;div&#62;</code> <b>elements</b></h4>

        <p>At times is fairly difficult to decide which element is the best for the job, either the <code>&#60;article&#62;</code>, the <code>&#60;section&#62;</code> or the <code>div</code> element. As any matter related to every semantic decision, the key is to look at the content. In a nutshell:</p>

        <p>If the content can be placed independently relocated without loose meaning, use the element <code>&#60;article&#62;</code>.</p>

        <p>If the content represent a thematic group of content and adds to the document outline, then use the <code>section</code> element. Keep in mind that both, the <code>&#60;article&#62;</code> and <code>&#60;section&#62;</code> element contribute to a document's structure and help to outline a document.</p>

        <p>But in the other hand, the displayed content is wrapped only for stylish purposes use the <code>&#60;div&#62;</code> element.</p>

<!-- 16.11.16 (back in the game) -->
    <h3>Navigation</h3>

      <p>The <code>&#60;nav&#62;</code> element should be used for <strong>major</strong> navigational links on a page <i>i.e. not small section details.</i> such as global navigation, table of contents, previous/next links, or other <strong>noteworthy</strong> groups of navigational links. The <code>&#60;nav&#62;</code> element also <strong>identifies</strong> a section of major navigational links on a page. In other words, the <code>&#60;nav&#62;</code> elements behaves a a milestone within the website for the main navigational sections.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, to handle miscellaneous one-off links the <code>&#60;a&#62;</code> (anchor) element should be used instead, and the anchor element alone.</p>

    <h3>Article</h3>

      <p>The <code>&#60;article&#62;</code> element is used to identify a section of independent, self-contained content that can be distributed or reused througout the website without lose meaning, like: blog post, user-submitted content, newspaper articles, and the like. The key to determine if it is appropiate to use the <code>&#60;article&#62;</code> element is to determine if that content could be extracted from the context of the page and placed, for example, within an e-mail or printed work, and should still make sense.</p>

      <p>The <code>&#60;aside&#62;</code> element holds content that is tangentially related to the content surrounding it, such as sidebars, brief explanations, inserts, etc. For instance when used <strong>within</strong> an <code>&#60;article&#62;</code> element, for example, the <code>&#60;aside&#62;</code> element may identify content related to the author of the article. Instinctively the <code>&#60;aside&#62;</code> element might be thought to be placed in the right or left side of a page. However, as block-level element will fill up the whole page or parent element width unless stated otherwise.</p>

    <h3>Footer</h3>

      <p>This element identifies the closing or end of an: <i>element</i>, <i>page</i>, <i>article</i>, <i>section</i>, <i>box</i>, or other segement of a page. As its name suggest, is located at the bottom of its parent element. The content holded by the <code>&#60;footer&#62;</code> should be related information and should not diverge from the document or section it is included within.</p>

      <h4>Encoding special characters</h4>

        <p>When typing directly into HTML certain characters, specially punctuation marks, accented letters, symbols among others, they can be misunderstood or mistaken for the wrong character; to avoid this instead the desired character is replaced by its unique encoded equivalent, in this way is not mistaken. Encoded characters begin with an ampersand <code>&</code>, and end with a semicolon <code>;</code>. What falls in between is the character unique encoding, be it a name or numeric encoding. For example, we could encode the word "resum&eacute;" as "<code>resum& eacute;</code>". An extensive list of character encodings may be found at <a href=http://copypastecharacter.com/>Copy Paste Character</a>.</p>

    <h3>Creating hyperlinks and connecting pages</h3>

      <p>One of the most important elements of the Internet is the hyperlink, they allow connect a website with another. In HTML they are know as <code>&#60;a&#62;</code> (anchor) and used to be in-line level elements only, but with the introduction of HTML5, they can now wrap any kind of level elements including block-level elements. The way to set up an hyperlink to another page is the following: <code>&#60;a href="website-address"&#62;Text to be displayed to the user&#60;a&#62;</code> the <code>&#60;href&#62;</code> attribute value identifies the destination of the link.</p>

      <h4>Relative & absolute paths</h4>

        <p>The two most common type of links, are:<br>
        The ones that point to other pages <strong>within</strong> the same website, and,<br>
        The ones that point to other pages <strong>outside</strong> the same website.</p>

        <p>The first type of links are know as <em>relative</em> and in the <code>href</code> attribute value, don't end in .com, .edu, .org, etc, but rather in the file name including its extension, e.g.: <code>href="about.html"</code>, <code>href="index.css"</code>, <code>href="pink-floyd.mp3"</code>, <code>href="codex.pdf"</code>, etc. Should the page being linked to reside within a different directory, or folder, the <code>href</code> attribute value needs to reflect this as well. Say the <code>about.html</code> page resides within the <code>pages</code> directory; the relative path would the be <code>pages/about.html</code>.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, the links to other pages <strong>outside</strong> the website, require an <em>absolute</em> reference. Here the <code>href</code> attribute has the following structure: <code>href="http://web-address.domain"</code>, e.g.: <code>http:wikipedia.org</code>.</p>

      <h4>Linking to an e-mail address</h4>

        <p>Is also possible to link to an e-mail address, even including a subject line and full body text. For this the <code>href</code> attribute takes the following structure:<br>
        <h5>Blank e-mail (neither subject nor body):</h5><br>
        <code>href="mailto:theemailaddress@domain.com"</code><br>
        <h5>E-mail with subject line:</h5><br>
        <code>href="mailto:theemailaddress@domain.com<b>?</b>subject=Your%20Subject%20Line"</code>
        <i>The <code>?</code> binds the e-mail address with the subject attribute, and the <code>%20</code> is the <strong>encoding</strong> for the space character.</i><br>
        <h5>E-mail with subject line and body text</h5><br>
        <code>href="mailto:theemailaddress@doamin.com?subject=Your%20Subject%20Line<b>&</b>body=Write%20your%20message."</code></p>

        <p>Here is the full example:<br>
        <code><a href="mailto:theemailaddress@doamin.com?subject=Your%20Subject%20Line<b>&</b>body=Write%20your%20message.">E-mail sample</a></code></p>

      <h4>Linking to a new window</h4>

        <p>Usually links open in the very same window, just sometimes this behaviour isn't desired, instead, is preferred if it opens in a new window, to trigger this action, the <code>target</code> attribute is added to the <code>&#60;a&#62;</code> tag. For example: to open <code>stackoverflow.com</code> in a new window, the anchor tag would be this: <code>&#60;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank"&#62;Stackoverflow&#60;a&#62;</code>. The utility of the <code>target=""</code> attribute is that determines the link behaviour when it's clicked.</p>

      <h4>Linking/jumping to parts of the same page</h4>

        <p>In a similar fashion as in the case of linking to new windows, is possible to link/jump to parts on the same webpage by the use of an attribute with the <code>href</code> attribute value. In this case, is necessary to first create an <code>id</code> attribute <strong>on</strong> the element we wish to link to, then, using the value of that <code>id</code> attribute within an anchor element's <code>href</code> attribute. For example, the well known "Back to top" that sends/returns the user to the top/begining of the page once is clicked:<br>
        <code>&#60;body id="top"</code> <i>here the <code>id</code> <b>on</b> the element we wish to link to is created</i><br>
        <code>...<br>
        &#60;a href="<b>#</b>top"&#62;Back to top&#60;/a&#62;</code> <i>the pound sign necessarily precedes the value in the <code>id</code> attribute.</i><br>
        <code>...<br>
        &#60;/body&#62;</code></p>
