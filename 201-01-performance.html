      <p>The capability of write HTML and CSS is an asset, however, this by its own is not enough. As websites and traffic become bigger, also becomes the importance of optimizing it from a performance point of view, that is basically considering speed criterion such as: 1) the size of the files sent to the server and, 2) the number of request to it. The first objective is achieved using strategies structuring and getting a modular code as explained below. The second goal, is obtained by "asking" as few times as possible to the server in a relevant way to get more from each answer. Taking the time to optimize a website will pay off in the long run, allowing code be easily re-factored, quickly rendered, and speed up production. Additionally, web site performance greatly resembles the 80/20 rule, where 20% of the optimizations will speed up roughly 80% of the website.</p>
