This repository contain exercises and personal notes in the path to acquire web development skills, although several learning and material sources have been employed, the scope has been determined by the approach and curriculum used at Launch School (LS - launchschool.com).

Also, given the huge amount of information available online, for the sake of organization and structure during the learning process, the resources used leading to the code in this repository have been enclosed by the ones suggested and/or followed at LS. With this in mind, and with the exception of some notes, all code here is from my authorship, should you find it useful in any way, feel free to use it and/or modify it at will.

Additionally, along during the process, it has been intended to push code updates on a daily basis, however, this has not been always the case, specially when following courses like the ones offered at codecademy or related websites.

Any questions or inquiries you might have don't hesitate in contact me at atzzom at gmail dot com.

Happy Coding!
