This repository contain exercises and personal notes in the path to acquire web development skills, although several learning and material sources have been employed, the scope has been determined by the approach and curriculum used at Launch School (LS - launchschool.com).

Additionally, given the huge amount of information available online, for the sake of organization and structure during the learning process, the code contained here has been built up exclusively from the knowledge gotten with the learning resources at hand (the ones being followed/suggested by LS), that been said, with the exception of some notes, no code here has been copy-pasted. Should you find it useful in any way, feel free to use it and/or modify it at will.

Along during the process, it has been intended to push code updates on a daily basis, however, this has not been always the case, specially when following courses like the offered on codecademy or related websites.

Any questions or inquiries you might have don't hesitate in contact me at atzzom at gmail dot com.

Happy Coding!
