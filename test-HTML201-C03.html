	<h6>Shay Howe's demo on child & sibling selectors</h6>

		<p>This is a test page in order to find why when using some sibling selectors the page won't be displayed as intended</p>

		<p>What has been found is that with the declared child and sibling selectors, the button is going to be rendered as intended, however, this only happened once the class="float-container" of the parent &lt;section&gt; element was removed, that is to say, that the styles were rendered only when the CSS selector used as prequalifier "section (+/ /~ element)" instead of the original "section.float-container (+/ /~ element)".</p>

		<p>Additionally, another case was tested, namely, when the prequalifier of the declared element was set to: ".float-container (child/adj/sibling element)", it was seen that works as intended, as in the case outlined above, that is, when this prequalifier replaced the original "section.float-container (child/adj/sibling element)".</p>
