I have some more questions.

--- Calculations in insert mode using i_ctrl-r-= ---
6 chairs, each costing $35, totals $210 

--- Inserting unusual characters with unicode ---

- Use i-ctrl-v-### to insert a character by decimal code.
- Use i_ctrl-v-u#### where # represents an hex number, eg: i_ctrl-v-u00bf = Â¿.
- also the ascii representation of a symbol into the document can be retrieved using the ga command (get ascii).
- A very useful trick specially when a key has been mapped to another value, is to use i_ctrl-v-{key} to insert the character represented by that key, for example, if by pressing a Tab, vim translate it to spaces, then using i_ctrl-v-Tab will insert an actual Tab (not the mapped spaces when the 'expandtab' option is enabled).
- Additionally using i_ctrl-k-{char1}-{char2} will insert the character represented by the {char1}-{char2} digraph. More info: h: digraphs-default. 

--- Visual mode ---

Visual mode is a way to select text that resembles the way text editors work, however, visual mode has three 'submodes' that allows work with different granulity levels, namely:
v --> character-wise visual mode.
V --> line-wise visual mode.
ctrl-v --> block-wise visual mode.
gv --> reselect last visual selection.

eg:
Select from here to here
