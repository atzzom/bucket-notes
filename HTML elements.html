<h1>List of HTML elements</h1>

  <p>The following is the list of the HTML elements according to the <a href="w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</a></p>

  <h2>HTML elements by function</h2>

    <h3>1. Root element</h3>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><code><b>&#60;html&#62;</b></code></td>
          <td>Root element. Represents the root of the document, all possible elements must be descendants of this element, that is to say that is the parent element of any possible element within the document.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

    <h3>2. Document metadata</h3>

      <p>Metadata provides information about the page like styles, scripts and data that help software as browsers, search engines, etc. to use and render the page.</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><code><b>&#60;base&#62;</b></code></td>
          <td>This will serve as the base for all <i>relative</i> URL contained within the document. There only can be one <code>&#60;base&#62;</code> element in the document.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code><b>&#60;head&#62;</b></code></td>
          <td>Document metadata container. Collects the document's metadata, providing the general information about the document, including its title and links to its scripts and style sheets.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code><b>&#60;link&#62;</b></code></td>
          <td>Represents metadata that expresses inter-document relationships (external resources). Possible uses for this element include <i class="faq">defining a relational framework for navigation (what does this exactly mean/examples)</i>, and is mostly used to link to style sheets.<i class="faq">insert examples of its usage.</i></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code><b>&#60;meta&#62;</b></code></td>
          <td>A multipurpose element for representing metadata that cannot be represented by one of the other HTML meta-related elements (<code>&#60;base&#62;</code>, <code>&#60;link&#62;</code>, <code>&#60;script&#62;</code>, <code>&#60;style&#62;</code>, or <code>&#60;title&#62;</code>). Can have the following attributes: <i class="faq">insert examples, turn the bullets into a list.</i></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>: <br>
      - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/meta.name.html#meta.name">name</a><br>
      - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/meta.http-equiv.refresh.html#meta.http-equiv.refresh">http-equiv=refresh</a><br>

      <p><code><b>&#60;style&#62;</b></code>: allows information to be embedded in documents. This information  might affect the whole or part of the document. By default the style instructions written inside this element are expected to be CSS.<i class="faq">insert examples of its usage.</i></p>

      <p><code>&#60;title&#62;</code>: define the title of the document shown in a browser's title bar or on the page's tab. It can only contain text, and andy contained tags are ignored.</p>

    <h3>3. Scripting</h3>

      <p>As pages added interactivity, web applications, and dynamic content, HTML supports the use of scripting languages, most prominently JavaScript. The follwing elements support this type of features:</p>

      <p><code>&#60;canvas&#62;</code>: element used to draw graphics via scripting (usually JavaScript), make photo compositions or even perform animations. Is strongly suggested to provide alternate content inside the <code>&#60;canvas&#62;</code> block so the information will be displayed in older browsers that don't suppport this feature or in browsers with JavaScript disabled.</p>

      <p><code><b>&#60;noscript&#62;</b></code>: defines a section of HTML elements to be inserted if a script type is unsupported or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser.</p>

      <p><code><b>&#60;script&#62;</b></code>: used to embed or reference an executable script within an HTML or XHTML document.</p>

    <h3>4. Sections</h3>

      <p>The content sectioning elements allow organize the document content into logical pieces, creating an outline for the content, including header and footer navigation, and heading elements to identify sections of content.</p>

      <p><code><b>&#60;address&#62;</b></code>: this element provides contact information for its nearest <code>&#60;article&#62;</code> or <code>&#60;body&#62;</code> ancestor; in the latter case, it applies to the whole document. <i class="faq">see examples.</i></p>

      <p><code><b>&#60;article&#62;</b></code>: represents a self-contained content or composition in a document (page, application, or site), which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g. in syndication). Such as, a forum, blog post, newspaper or magazine article, an object, or any other independent item of content. Each <code>&#60;article&#62;</code> should be identified, typically by including a heading (<code>&#60;h1&#62;&mdash;&#60;h6&#62;</code> element) as a child of the <code>&#60;article&#62;</code> element.</p>

      <p><code><b>&#60;aside&#62;</b></code>: this element is intendend to hold information tangentially connected to the rest of the document or section, but that can be considered separate from that content. For example, a glossary, information/biography of the author, web applications, profile information or related links.</p>

      <p><code><b>&#60;footer&#62;</b></code>: this element represents the footer for its <b>nearest sectioning content</b> or <b>nearest sectioning root</b> element. It typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related docuemnts.</p>

      <p><code><b>&#60;header&#62;</b></code>: represents a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain, a logo, wrapped section's header, search bar/form, and so on.</p>

    <h3>Text content</h3>

      <p>The text content elements help organizing sections, blocks and pieces of information within the opening <code>&#60;body&#62;</code> and closing <code>&#60;/body&#62;</code> tags.

It should be used only when no other semantic element &mdash;such as <code>&#60;article&#62;</code> or <code>&#60;nav&#62;</code>&mdash; is appropriate.</p>

      <p><code><b>&#60;dl&#62;</b></code>: <i>description list</i> common uses for this element are: glossaries, display metadata (a list of key-value pairs). Basically encloses a list of groups of terms and descriptions.</p>
