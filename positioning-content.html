  <p>One of the most important features of CSS is the possibility to place content in almost any desired way, bringing structure to the document and making the content more digestible. There are different options to do this, each with its own application, allowing the creation of reusable layouts and uniquely positioning one&ndash;off elements.</p>

    <h2>Positioning with floats</h2>

      <p>A very useful way to position element is with the <code>float</code> property, this feature, allow us to take an element, and remove it from the normal flow of the page, and position it next to its parent element (either in its left or right). All other elements on the page will then flow around the floated element. For example and <code>&#60;img&#62;</code> element floated to the side of a few paragraphs of text, will allow these paragraphs to wrap around the image as necessary.</p>

      <p>When the <code>float</code> property is used on multiple elements at the same time, it provides the ability to create a layout by floating elements directly to or opposite each other, as seen in multiple-column layouts. <i class="faq">What exaclty this means? examples of this?</i>. The <code>float</code> property accepts a few values, being the most popular <code>left</code> and <code>right</code><br>
      <code>img {<br>
      float: left;<br>
      }</code></p>

        <h3>Floats in practice <i class="review">add link to another page with solved example</i></h3>

          <p>In a common page layout with a header, two columns in the center, and a footer at the bottom, the elements would look like this:</p>

          <div>
            <header><code>&#60;header&#62;</code></header>
            <div><code>&#60;section&#62;</code></div>
            <aside><code>&#60;aside&#62;</code></aside>
            <footer><code>&#60;footer&#62;</code></footer>
          </div>

          <p>See the <a href="ex-float-00.html" target="_blank">page here</a>.</p>

          <i class="faq">how to shrink images to fit the screen size? Ans/ set <code>width: 100%;</code></i>

          <p>Here, as block-level elements the <code>&#60;section&#62;</code> and <code>&#60;aside&#62;</code> elements will be stacked in top of one another by default. However, in the cases when setting these elements side by side is necessary/desired, by floating these elements is possible position them as two columns sitting opposite one another. The CSS to do so look like this:</p>

          <code>section {<br>
          float: left;<br>
          }<br>
          aside {<br>
          float: right;<br>
          }</code>

          <p>See an example of how this page would look like <a href="ex-float-01-1.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="ex-float-01-2.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <p>When an element is floated, it will float all the way to the edge of its parent element; when no parent element is present, then, it will float all the way to the edge of the page. Floating an element will remove it from the normal flow of the page, and as seen in the previous examples, this causes the width to default the width of the content within it. This situation isn't always desirable, for example, when creating columns for a reusable layout that can have different contents. Fortunately this can be corrected setting up a fixed or proportional (percentage) width, and additionally, to avoid elements from touching one another, causing the content of one to sit directly next to the content of the other, we can use the <code>margin</code> property to create space between elements.</p>

          <p>In this <a href="ex-float-01-3.html" target="_blank">example</a> a <code>margin</code> and a <code>width</code> are added to the columns of layout of the previous example to better shape the desired outcome.</p>

          <code>
            section {<br>
            float: left;<br>
            margin: 0 1.5%<br>
            width: 63%;<br>
            }<br>
            aside {<br>
            float: right;<br>
            margin: 0 1.5%;<br>
            width: 30%<br>
            }
          </code>

          <p>Once this <code>margin</code> and <code>width</code> are applied the layout looks like this, notice that when inspecting the page, although the <code>footer</code> element still touches the <code>section</code> and <code>aside</code> elements, the last two don't touches one another any more. On the other hand, the values for the <code>margin</code> and <code>width</code> has been set up in such a way that add up to the 100%, filling out the entire width of its parente element (<code>body</code> in this case).</p>

          <img src="ex-float-03.png">

          <p>In order to prevent the <code>&#60;footer&#62;</code> from overlap the <code>&#60;section&#62;</code> elements, is necessary to include the following code in the CSS file:</p>
          <code>footer {<br>
          clear: both;<br>
          margin-bottom: 0;<br>
          }</code>

          <p>See the page with the above code implemented <a href="ex-float-01-4.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <div class="comment-box">
            <h4>Floating an element might change the value for its display property</h4>

            <p>As floating an element removes it from the normal flow of the page, this property will also handle any time of floated element as a <code>block</code> element, hence, if an <code>inline</code> element is floated (i.e. ignoring any possible <code>height</code> or <code>width</code> value) it will now be treated as a block element, being possible to assign a width and height value.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Building a three column layout with floats</h3>

          <p>In the previous exercise two columns were displayed by floating one to the left and the other to the right. If more columns are desired, the approach to take will be slightly different; Say, for example, we'd like to have a row of three columns between our <code>&#60;header&#62;</code> and <code>&#60;footer&#62;</code> elements. If the <code>&#60;aside&#62;</code> element is dropped and three <code>&#60;section&#62;</code> elements are used, the HTML look like this:</p>

          <code>
            &#60;header&#62;...&#60;/header&#62;<br>
            &#60;section&#62;...&#60;/section&#62;<br>
            &#60;section&#62;...&#60;/section&#62;<br>
            &#60;section&#62;...&#60;/section&#62;<br>
            &#60;footer&#62;...&#60;/footer&#62;<br>
          </code>

        <p>The layout of the page is shown below  and in this <a href="ex-float-01-5.html" target="_blank">link</a>:</p>

        <img src="ex-float-05.png">

        <p>In this case, instead of float one column to the left and the other to the right, all three <code>&#60;section&#62;</code> elements are floated to the left, in this case is necessary to adjust the width of the <code>&#60;section&#62;</code> elements to account for the additional columns and to get them to sit one next to the other.</p>

        <code>
          section {<br>
          float: left;<br>
          margin: 0 1.5%;<br>
          width: 30%;<br>
          }
        </code>

        <p>Once this CSS code for floating the elements is applied, the layout will look like <a href="ex-float-01-6.html" target="_blank">this</a>:</p>
