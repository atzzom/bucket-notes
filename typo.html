    <p>As browsers started to be able to embed fonts into computers, those, were not longer limited to only render the fonts installed by default. This, opened a vast amount of options to choose from when selecting a font, in order to make the most out of them, is mandatory know and be aware of the basic typography principles.</p>
    
    <div class="frame">
        <h3>Typeface vs. font</h3>
        
        <p>The terms "typeface" amd "font" are often interchanged, causing confusion. Here is a breakdown of exactly what ech term means.</p>
        
        <p>A <em>typeface</em> is what we see. It is the artistic impression of how text looks, feels, and reads.</p>
        
        <p>A <em>font</em> is a file that contains a typeface. Using a font on a computer allows the computer to access the typeface.</p>
        
        <p>One way to help clarify the difference between a typeface and a font is to compare them to a song and and MP3. A typeface is very similar to a song in that it is a work of art. It is created by an artist or artists and is open to public interpretation. A font, on hte other hand, is very similar to an MP3 in that it is not the artistic impression itself, but only a method of delivering the artistic value.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="color">Adding color to text</h2>
        
    <p>This, with the typeface, is one of the first decisions to be made when building a website, and is also one of the most powerful elements to set an unmistakable personality to the page, as they have the largest impact on the look and legibility of the page.</p>
        
    <p>The <code>color</code> property sets and modifies the text color, allowing only one value, that can be expressed in different formats, as <code>rgb</code>, <code>rgba</code>, <code>HSL</code>, <code>HSLa</code>, and <code>hexadecimal</code> vlaues. The latter are preferred as provide great control with littel effort. As example, the following CSS will change the color of all the text within the <code>&#60;html&#62;</code> element on a page:</p>
    
    <code>
        html {<br>
        color: #555;<br>
        }
    </code>

    <h2>Changing font properties</h2>
    
    <p>Within the available typography properties, they are classified in two categories: font-based properties and tex-based properties. They are easily identifiable because most of these will be preface with either <code>font-*</code> or <code>text-*</code>.</p>
    
    <section id="font-based">
        
        <h3>Font-based properties</h3>
        
            <h4>Font family</h4>
            
            <p>The <code>font-family</code> property is used to declare which font -as well as which fallback or substitue fonts- should be used to display text. The value of the <code>font-family</code> property contains multiple font names, all comma separated. The fist declared font (starting from the left), is the primary font choice. If this font is unavailable, then, the alternative declared fonts will follow after it in order of preference from left to right.</p>
            
            <p>When declaring fonts, take into account that font names with more than one word must be declared wrapped in quotation marks. Additionally, the las font should be a keyword value, which will use the system default faont for the specidied type, most commonly either <code>sans-serif</code> or <code>serif</code>.</p>
            
            <p>The following is an example of the declaration of the <code>font-family</code> property.</p>
            
            <code>body {<br>
            font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;<br>
            }</code>
            
            <p>According to the previously exposed, the font of choice will be <code>Helvetica Neue</code>, should this font will be unavailable/uninstalled, then the <code>Helvetica</code> font will follow, and so on until <code>sans-serif</code> provided the <code>Arial</code> font isn't available either.</p>
            
            <h4>Font size</h4>
            
            <p>The <code>font-size</code> property provides the ability to set the size of text using common length values, including pixels, em units, percentages, points, or <code>>font-size</code> keywords <i class=faq>which are those keywords for the font-size property?</i></p>
            
            <p>Here is a CSS example setting the <code>font-size</code> of the <code>&#60;body&#62;</code> element to <code>14px</code>.</p>
            
            <code>
                body {<br>
                font-size: 14px;<br>
                }
            </code>
            
            <h4>Font style</h4>
            
            <p>This property is commonly used to set text to italics, or to prevent text from being italicized. This property accepts, four keyword values, namely: <code>normal</code>, <code>italic</code>, <code>oblique</code>, and <code>inherit</code>. The following CSS sets all elements with a class of <code>special</code> to include a <code>font-style</code> of <code>italic</code>:</p>
            
            <code>
                .special {<br>
                font-style: italic;<br>
                }
            </code>
            
            <h4>Font variant</h4>
            
            <p>This property is used mostly in the rare cases the text needs to be displayed in small capitals, known also as small caps. The <code>font-variant</code> property accepts three values: <code>normal</code>, <code>small-caps</code>, and <code>inherit</code>. The following example shows all the elements with a class of firm to a <code>font-variant</code> of <code>small-caps</code>:</p>
            
            <code>
                .firm {<br>
                font-variant: small-caps;<br>
                }
            </code>
            
            <p><i>show practical examples of these properties.</i></p>
            
            <h4>Font weight</h4>
            
            <p>This property makes reference to the thickness of the typeface, is used to make the text bolder or lighter, this property accepts both, keyword and numerical values.</p>
            
            <p>Keyword values include <code>normal</code>, <code>bold</code>, <code>bolder</code>, <codee>lighter</codee>, and <code>inherit</code>. Of these keyword values, it is recommeded to primarily use <code>normal</code> and <code>bold</code> to change text from normal to bold an vice versa. Rather than using the keyword values <code>bolder</code> or <code>lighter</code>, it's better to use a numeric value for more specific control. Here is an example of the use of the <code>font-weight</code> property using keyword values:</p>
            
            <code>
                .daring {<br>
                font-weight: bold;<br>
                }
            </code>
            
            <p>On the other hand, when adjusting this property using numerical values, the <code>font-weight</code> property accepts the following weights: <code>100</code>, <code>200</code>, <code>300</code>, <code>400</code>, <code>500</code>, <code>600</code>, <code>700</code>, <code>800</code>, and <code>900</code>, being <code>100</code> the lightlest weight, and <code>900</code> the boldest/strongest weight.</p>
            
            <p>For reference, the keyword value of <code>normal</code> maps to <code>400</code> and the keyword <code>bold</code> maps to <code>700</code>; thus, any numeric value below <code>400</code> will be fairly thin, and any value above <code>700</code> will be fairly thick.</p>
            
            <p>In this example, changing the <code>font-weight</code> to <code>600</code> for any element with the class of <code>daring</code> now renders that text as semibold-not quite as thick as the <code>bold</code> keyword value from before:</p>
            
            <code>
                .daring {<br>
                font-weigth: 600;<br>
                }
            </code>
            
            <div class="comment-box">
                
                <h4>Typeface weights</h4>
                
                <p>Before using a numeric value, we need to check and see whether the typefacewe are using comes in the weight we'd like to use. Attempting to use a weight that's not available for a given typeface will cause those styles to default to the closest value. For example, the Times New Roman typeface comes in two weights: <code>normal</code> (<code>400</code>), and <code>bold</code> (<code>700</code>). Attempting to use a weight of <code>900</code> will default the typeface to the closest related weight, <code>700</code> in this case.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Line height</h3>
            
            <p>Line height or leading, is the distance between two lines of text, is declared useing the <code>line-height</code> property. The <code>line-height</code> property accepts all general lenght values, like pixels, percentages, and em.</p>
            
            <p>The best practice for legibility is to set the <code>line-height</code> to around one and a half times the <code>font-size</code> property value. This could be quickly accomplished by setting the leading/<code>line-height</code> to <code>150%</code>, or just <code>1.5</code>. However, if we're working with a baseline grid, having a little more control over our <code>line-height</code> using pixels may be preferable.</p>
            
            <p>The following CSS sets <code>22px</code> between lines of text:</p>
            
            <code>
                body {<br>
                line-height: 22px;<br>
                }
            </code>
            
            <p>A little trick to vertically center text can be done making equal the <code>height</code> with the <code>line-height</code>, this technique is commonly used with buttons, alert messages, and other single-line text blocks. </code><i class="faq">what's the difference between the <code>height</code> and the <code>font-size</code>?</i></p>
            
            <h4>Shorthand font properties</h4>
            
            <p>As many other properties, the <code>font</code> property accepts shorthand declarations, needless to say, all of the stated properties must be font-based. The order to declare these properties is the following from left to right: <code>font-style</code>, <code>font-variant</code>, <code>font-weight</code>, <code>font-size</code>, <code>line-height</code>, and <code>font-family</code>. As a shorthand declaration, no commans must be present within each value, only with the exception of font names, as the <code>font-family</code> property value uses commas, otherwise, as usual, should a value have more than one word, it must be wrapped in quotation marks. Additionally, a forward slash, <code>/</code>, separator is needed between the <code>font-size</code> and <code>line-height</code>, like this: <code>font-size/line-height</code>, <code>18px/27px</code>.</p>
            
            <p>In shorthand declaration for the <code>font</code> property all values are optional but the <code>font-size</code> and <code>font-family</code>. That said, it is possible include only the <code>font-size</code> and <code>font-family</code> property values in the shrothand value if desired.</p>
            
            <code>
                html {<br>
                font: italic small-caps bold 14px/22px "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;<br>
                }
            </code>
            
            <h2>Font properties all together</h2>
            
            <p>The following examples show the use of the font-based properties together. The following HTML and CSS demosntrates the different possibilities when styling text.</p>
            
            <p>HTML</p>

            <code>

                <h4>CSS pseudo-classes</h4>
                
                <p>The previous example shows the <code>:hover</code> CSS pseudo-class. For reference, pseudo-classes are keywords that may be added to the end of a selector to style an element when it's in a unique state. The <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class styles and element when a uses hovers over that element. When used with the <code>&#60;a&#62;</code> element, as shown above, all <code>&#60;a&#62;</code> elements will receive unique styles when they are hovered over. Now the <code>&#60;a&#62;</code> elements will chage color upon being hovered over.</p>
