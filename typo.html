    <p>As browsers started to be able to embed fonts into computers, those, were not longer limited to only render the fonts installed by default. This, opened a vast amount of options to choose from when selecting a font, in order to make the most out of them, is mandatory know and be aware of the basic typography principles.</p>
    
    <div class="frame">
        <h3>Typeface vs. font</h3>
        
        <p>The terms "typeface" amd "font" are often interchanged, causing confusion. Here is a breakdown of exactly what ech term means.</p>
        
        <p>A <em>typeface</em> is what we see. It is the artistic impression of how text looks, feels, and reads.</p>
        
        <p>A <em>font</em> is a file that contains a typeface. Using a font on a computer allows the computer to access the typeface.</p>
        
        <p>One way to help clarify the difference between a typeface and a font is to compare them to a song and and MP3. A typeface is very similar to a song in that it is a work of art. It is created by an artist or artists and is open to public interpretation. A font, on hte other hand, is very similar to an MP3 in that it is not the artistic impression itself, but only a method of delivering the artistic value.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="color">Adding color to text</h2>
        
    <p>This, with the typeface, is one of the first decisions to be made when building a website, and is also one of the most powerful elements to set an unmistakable personality to the page, as they have the largest impact on the look and legibility of the page.</p>
        
    <p>The <code>color</code> property sets and modifies the text color, allowing only one value, that can be expressed in different formats, as <code>rgb</code>, <code>rgba</code>, <code>HSL</code>, <code>HSLa</code>, and <code>hexadecimal</code> vlaues. The latter are preferred as provide great control with littel effort. As example, the following CSS will change the color of all the text within the <code>&#60;html&#62;</code> element on a page:</p>
    
    <code>
        html {<br>
        color: #555;<br>
        }
    </code>

    <h2>Changing font properties</h2>
    
    <p>Within the available typography properties, they are classified in two categories: font-based properties and tex-based properties. They are easily identifiable because most of these will be preface with either <code>font-*</code> or <code>text-*</code>.</p>
    
    <section id="font-based">
        
        <h3>Font-based properties</h3>
        
            <h4>Font family</h4>
            
            <p>The <code>font-family</code> property is used to declare which font -as well as which fallback or substitue fonts- should be used to display text. The value of the <code>font-family</code> property contains multiple font names, all comma separated. The fist declared font (starting from the left), is the primary font choice. If this font is unavailable, then, the alternative declared fonts will follow after it in order of preference from left to right.</p>
            
            <p>When declaring fonts, take into account that font names with more than one word must be declared wrapped in quotation marks. Additionally, the las font should be a keyword value, which will use the system default faont for the specidied type, most commonly either <code>sans-serif</code> or <code>serif</code>.</p>
            
            <p>The following is an example of the declaration of the <code>font-family</code> property.</p>
            
            <code>body {<br>
            font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;<br>
            }</code>
            
            <p>According to the previously exposed, the font of choice will be <code>Helvetica Neue</code>, should this font will be unavailable/uninstalled, then the <code>Helvetica</code> font will follow, and so on until <code>sans-serif</code> provided the <code>Arial</code> font isn't available either.</p>
            
            <h4>Font size</h4>
            
            <p>The <code>font-size</code> property provides the ability to set the size of text using common length values, including pixels, em units, percentages, points, or <code>>font-size</code> keywords <i class=faq>which are those keywords for the font-size property?</i></p>
            
            <p>Here is a CSS example setting the <code>font-size</code> of the <code>&#60;body&#62;</code> element to <code>14px</code>.</p>
            
            <code>
                body {<br>
                font-size: 14px;<br>
                }
            </code>
            
            <h4>Font style</h4>
            
            <p>This property is commonly used to set text to italics, or to prevent text from being italicized. This property accepts, four keyword values, namely: <code>normal</code>, <code>italic</code>, <code>oblique</code>, and <code>inherit</code>. The following CSS sets all elements with a class of <code>special</code> to include a <code>font-style</code> of <code>italic</code>:</p>
            
            <code>
                .special {<br>
                font-style: italic;<br>
                }
            </code>
            
            <h4>Font variant</h4>
            
            <p>This property is used mostly in the rare cases the text needs to be displayed in small capitals, known also as small caps. The <code>font-variant</code> property accepts three values: <code>normal</code>, <code>small-caps</code>, and <code>inherit</code>. The following example shows all the elements with a class of firm to a <code>font-variant</code> of <code>small-caps</code>:</p>
            
            <code>
                .firm {<br>
                font-variant: small-caps;<br>
                }
            </code>
            
            <p><i>show practical examples of these properties.</i></p>
            
            <h4>Font weight</h4>
            
            <p>This property makes reference to the thickness of the typeface, is used to make the text bolder or lighter, this property accepts both, keyword and numerical values.</p>
            
            <p>Keyword values include <code>normal</code>, <code>bold</code>, <code>bolder</code>, <codee>lighter</codee>, and <code>inherit</code>. Of these keyword values, it is recommeded to primarily use <code>normal</code> and <code>bold</code> to change text from normal to bold an vice versa. Rather than using the keyword values <code>bolder</code> or <code>lighter</code>, it's better to use a numeric value for more specific control. Here is an example of the use of the <code>font-weight</code> property using keyword values:</p>
            
            <code>
                .daring {<br>
                font-weight: bold;<br>
                }
            </code>
            
            <p>On the other hand, when adjusting this property using numerical values, the <code>font-weight</code> property accepts the following weights: <code>100</code>, <code>200</code>, <code>300</code>, <code>400</code>, <code>500</code>, <code>600</code>, <code>700</code>, <code>800</code>, and <code>900</code>, being <code>100</code> the lightlest weight, and <code>900</code> the boldest/strongest weight.</p>
            
            <p>For reference, the keyword value of <code>normal</code> maps to <code>400</code> and the keyword <code>bold</code> maps to <code>700</code>; thus, any numeric value below <code>400</code> will be fairly thin, and any value above <code>700</code> will be fairly thick.</p>
            
            <p>In this example, changing the <code>font-weight</code> to <code>600</code> for any element with the class of <code>daring</code> now renders that text as semibold-not quite as thick as the <code>bold</code> keyword value from before:</p>
            
            <code>
                .daring {<br>
                font-weigth: 600;<br>
                }
            </code>
            Is necessary to keep in mind that these set of values, applies only to the typefaces that accepts multiple weights, should a typeface
