    <p>As browsers started to be able to embed fonts into computers, those, were not longer limited to only render the fonts installed by default. This, opened a vast amount of options to choose from when selecting a font, in order to make the most out of them, is mandatory know and be aware of the basic typography principles.</p>
    
    <div class="frame">
        <h3>Typeface vs. font</h3>
        
        <p>The terms "typeface" amd "font" are often interchanged, causing confusion. Here is a breakdown of exactly what ech term means.</p>
        
        <p>A <em>typeface</em> is what we see. It is the artistic impression of how text looks, feels, and reads.</p>
        
        <p>A <em>font</em> is a file that contains a typeface. Using a font on a computer allows the computer to access the typeface.</p>
        
        <p>One way to help clarify the difference between a typeface and a font is to compare them to a song and and MP3. A typeface is very similar to a song in that it is a work of art. It is created by an artist or artists and is open to public interpretation. A font, on hte other hand, is very similar to an MP3 in that it is not the artistic impression itself, but only a method of delivering the artistic value.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="color">Adding color to text</h2>
        
    <p>This, with the typeface, is one of the first decisions to be made when building a website, and is also one of the most powerful elements to set an unmistakable personality to the page, as they have the largest impact on the look and legibility of the page.</p>
        
    <p>The <code>color</code> property sets and modifies the text color, allowing only one value, that can be expressed in different formats, as <code>rgb</code>, <code>rgba</code>, <code>HSL</code>, <code>HSLa</code>, and <code>hexadecimal</code> vlaues. The latter are preferred as provide great control with littel effort. As example, the following CSS will change the color of all the text within the <code>&#60;html&#62;</code> element on a page:</p>
    
    <code>
        html {<br>
        color: #555;<br>
        }
    </code>

    <h2>Changing font properties</h2>
    
    <p>Within the available typography properties, they are classified in two categories: font-based properties and tex-based properties. They are easily identifiable because most of these will be preface with either <code>font-*</code> or <code>text-*</code>.</p>
    
    <section id="font-based">
        
        <h3>Font-based properties</h3>
        
            <h4>Font family</h4>
            
            <p>The <code>font-family</code> property is used to declare which font -as well as which fallback or substitue fonts- should be used to display text. The value of the <code>font-family</code> property contains multiple font names, all comma separated. The fist declared font (starting from the left), is the primary font choice.</p>
