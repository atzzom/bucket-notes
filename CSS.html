<h1>Getting to know CSS</h1>

  <p>CSS is the language in charge of provide with format and styles to the structural HTML elements in the webpage, it stands for <b>C</b>ascade <b>S</b>tyle <b>S</b>heet, and <i>pours</i> the different format from the top to the bottom of the document. Therefore, styles can be overwritten as the style sheet progresses.</p>

  <p>For example, at the begining of the casade (or at the begining of the CSS document) we the the paragraphs elements to have a blue background color, but later in the CSS document, the color is set up to green, then, the paragraphs are going to be rendered green.</p>

  <p><code>p {<br>
background: blue;<br>
font-size: 24px;<br>
}<br>
p {<br>
background: green;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>Because the paragraph selector that sets the background color to <code>green</code> comes after the paragraph selector that sets the background color to <code>blue</code>, it will take precedence in the cascade. All of the paragraphs will appear with a <code>green</code> background. the font size will remain <code>24</code> pixels because the second paragraph selector didn't identify a new font size.</p>

<p>The same effect will take place with the properties inside the individual selectors, as the cascade also <i>pour</i> them inside them, like this:</p>

<p><code>p {<br>
background: blue;<br>
background: green;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>As mentioned previously, the styles of the cascade will be cascade from the top to the bottom of the style sheet, but not always will be this way. Those times occur when different types of selectors are used and the <strong>specificity</strong> of those selectors breaks the cascade.</p>

<h3>Calculating Specificity</h3>

<p>In CSS each selector has a precedence/specificity, this, along with its placement in the cascade, determines how its styles will be rendered. The type, class and ID selector, each has a different specificity weight.</p>

<p>The lowest specificity weight is hold by the type selector with a value of <code>0-0-1</code>. The class selector has a medium specificity weight and holds a point value of <code>0-1-0</code>. Lastly, the ID selector has a high specificity weight or precedence with a value of <code>1-0-0</code>. Notice that the specificity/precedence is calculated using three columns. The first column counts ID selectors, the second columns counts class selectors, and the third column counts type selectors.</p>

<p>The specificity also can override a previously applied style, for example, if a paragraph is styled using a type selector in a first place, and later in the cascade is selected using a ID selector, as the latter has bigger precedence/specificity than the type selector, is going to override the type selector value regardless of its position in the cascade.</p>

<p>As the specificity values breaks the linearity of the cascade, although useful in many cases, it is also the cause of the styles not been rendered as intended.</p>

<h3>Combining selectors</h3>

<p>Individual selectors as type, class, and ID, can be combined together to be more granular and specific in the elements selection. For example, if within one element classified as <code>hotdog</code> we want to set all the paragraphs to have a <code>brown</code> background color. However, if one of those elements happens to have the class attribute of <code>mustard</code>, we want to set its background color to <code>yellow</code>. The HTML and CSS may look like the following:</p>

<p class="faq">Do the &#60;code&#60; element need to be nested inside a &#60;p&#60; element?</p>

<h5>HTML</h5>

<p><code>&#60;div class="hotdog"&#60;<br>
&#60;p&#60;...&#60;/p&#60;<br>
&#60;p&#60;...&#60;/p&#60;<br>
&#60;p class="mustard"&#60;...&#60;/p&#60;<br>
&#60;/div&#60;</code></p>

<h5>CSS</h5>

<p><code>.hotdog p {<br>
background: brown;<br>
}<br>
.hotdog p.mustard {<br>
background: yellow;<br>
}</code></p>

<!-- 16.11.18 -->

<p>When selectors are combined they are read from right to left. The selector inmediately before the curly brackect, is known as the <i>key selector</i>, because identifies exactly which element the styles will be applied to, for example, in the following scenario:</p>

<h5>HTML</h5>

<p><code>&#60;div class="hotdog"&#62;...&#60;/div&#62;<br>
&#60;a class="mustard" href="mustard.com"&#62;mustard&#60;/a&#62;<br>
&#60;p class="ketchup"&#62;...&#60;/p&#62;<br>
&#60;p class="hotdog"&#62;...&#60;/p&#62;<br>
&#60;footer class="end"&#62;...&#60;/footer&#62;</code></p>

<h5>CSS</h5>

<p><code>.hotdog p {<br>
background: brown;<br>
}<br>
.hotdog p.mustard {<br>
background: yellow;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>The first combined selector above, <code>.hotdog p</code>, includes two selectors: a class and a type selector, separated by a single space. The <em>key selector</em> targets <code>&#60;p&#62;</code> elements, but as is prequalified/preceded by the class selector <code>.hotdog</code>, this combined selector is going to chose: paragraphs element <b>THAT</b> are classified as/with <code>hotdog</code>.</p>

<p>The second selector <code>.hotdog p.mustard</code> is basically the same as the first one, with the addition of the class selector <code>.mustard</code>. This selector, is targeting paragraphs elements that are classified as <code>mustard</code> <b>AND</b> are <b>nested</b> into elements classified as <code>hotdog</code>. The absence of the space within these selectors would target: paragraphs elements classified as both: <code>mustard</code> <b>AND</b> <code>hotdog</code> at the same time, instead of nested. Following best practices, is desired not to prefix a class seletor (specificity <code>0-1-0</code>) with a type selector (specificity <code>0-0-1</code>), therefore if the best practice would be followed the selector should look like: <code>.hotdog .mustard</code></p>

<h3>Specificity with combined selectors</h3>

<p>Work out the specificity in the case of combined selector is pretty straighforward, for example, in the combined selector: <code>.hotdog p.mustard</code> it has one type selector (<code>0-0-1</code>), and two class selectors (<code>0-1-0</code>), therefore its specificity is <code>0-2-1</code> (two class and one type selector). Therefore we can deduce that the specificity of <code>.hotdog p.mustard</code> will be exactly the same as the one for: <code>p.mustard .hotdog</code>, or <code>.hotdog .mustard p</code>, or <code>p .hotdog.mustard</code>, etc, even though these combined selectors might deliver different results. These permutation in the specificity calculation translates to the fact that we can change the order of these selectors (<code>.hotdog p {}</code> and <code>.hotdog p.mustard</code>)  within our style sheet, placing the higher-weighted selector above the lower-weighted selector leading to the same result due to each selector's specificity weight. In general is desirable keep low specificity/precedence values as the higher the specificity the more likely the cascade is to break.</p>

<h3>Layering styles with multiple classes</h3>

<p>One way to keep the specificity as low as possible is to construct the website as modular as possible, to achive this, we can take advantage of the fact that HTML elements can have more than one class attribute as long as they are separated with a space, for example, the following element is classified as <code>interactive</code>, <code>code</code>, and <code>hello-world</code>:<br>
<code>&#60;article class"interactive code hello-world"&#62;Some content here.&#60;/article&#62;</code>.<br>
With these classifications is possible to place/layer certain style on all elements of one sort while placing/layering other styles only on specific elements of that sort.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at buttons, for example. Say we want all of our buttons to have afont size of <code>16px</code>, but we want the background color of our buttons to vary depending on where the buttons are used. We can create a few classes and layer them on an element as necessary to apply the desired styles.</p>

<h5>HTML</h5>

<p><code>&#60;a class="btn btn-danger"&#62;...&#60;/a&#62;<br>
&#60;a class="btn btn-success"&#62;...&#60;/a&#62;<br></code></p>

<h5>CSS</h5>

<p><code>.btn {<br>
font-size: 16px;<br>
}<br>
.btn-danger {<br>
background: red;<br>
.btn-success {<br>
background: green;<br>
}</code></p>

<!-- 16.11.20 -->

<p>It is possible to see here that a modular set up is really useful to apply different styles without a lot of rules in the <code>.css</code> document, keeping the code lean and specificity weights low.</p>

<h2>Common CSS property values</h2>

<p>As previously explained the CSS document is all about the apperance of our document. Between the parameters used for this are colors, length/sizes, among others, here, the first two are going to be explained.</p>

<h3>Colors</h3>

<p>All colors within CSS are defined on an sRGB (standard Red, Green, Blue) color space/standard. Colors within this space are formed by mixing red, green and blue, mirroring the way televisions and monitors generate all the different colors they display. Currently there are four ways to represent sRGB colors within CSS: keywords, hexadecimal notation, RGB and HSL values.</p>

<h4>Keyword colors</h4>

<p>Keyword color values are names (such as <code>red</code>, <code>green</code>, or <code>blue</code>) that map to a different color, these keyword names and their corresponding colors are determined by the CSS specification. A complete list of these keyword names can be found within the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/">CSS specification</a>.</p>

<!-- Insert table here with the most common colors for the specification -->

<p>Here there is an example of the application of a <code>maroon</code> background to any element with the <code>task</code> class attribute value and a <code>yellow</code> background to any element with the <code>count</code> class attribute value.</p>

<p><code>.task {<br>
background: maroon;<br>
}<br>
.count {<br>
background: yellow;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>Obviously, although these color values are simple in nature, they offer a limited spectre of options, thus are not the most popular color value choice.</p>

<h4>Hexadecimal colors</h4>

<p>Hexadecimals color values use an encoding to map the red, green, and blue color channels, consisting in a <code>#</code>, (pound, or hash) followed by a three- or six- character figure. As the base of these numbers is not decimal but hexadecimal, numbers consists in figures from <code>0</code> through <code>9</code> and letters form <code>a</code> through <code>f</code>.</p>

<p>In six-character notation, the first two characters are a matching pair, so are the third and fourth, and the fifth and sixth characters, each pair representing the red, green, and blue channels respectively. If <b>in every</b> matching pair (red, green, blue) both characters are the same, then, the hexadecimal number is shortened to a three figure number, where, of course, the first figure represents the red channel, the second figure the green channel and the third figure the blue channel.</p>

<p>The character pairs are obtained by converting <code>0</code> through <code>255</code> into a base-16, or hexadecimal format. Is useful to know that <code>0</code> equals black and <code>f</code> equals white.</p>

<p>The following is an example of the same <code>maroon</code> and <code>yellow</code> background colors from before but expressed in a hexadecimal base.<br>
<code>.task {<br>
background: #800000;</code> <i>Notice here that although the green and blue channels characters (last two pairs) are repeated, the number cannot be shortened to a three figure version because the red channel (first pair) has different characters <code>8</code>, and <code>0</code> respectively.</i><br>
<code>}<br>
.count {<br>
background: #ff0;</code> <i>This number is equivalent to <code>#ffff00</code></i><br>
<code>}</code></p>

<p>Because hexadecimal color values offers around 16.7 color values (256 options per channel, times three channels), is a fairly popular option, however, is a little difficult to work with when one is not familiar with them. Fortunately there are <a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/">color wheels</a> that help to find an specific color in its hexadecimal equivalent.</p>

<h4>RGB & RGBa colors</h4>

<p>The other way to render colors is using the <code>rgb()</code> function, which stands for red, green, and blue. The function accepts three comma-separated values, each of which is an integer from <code>0</code> to <code>255</code>. A value of <code>0</code> would be pure black; a value of <code>255</code> would be pure white. As it can be expected the first value within the <code>rgb()</code> function represents the red channel, the second value represents the green channel, and the third value represents the blue channel.</p>

<p>If we were to recreate the shade of orange from before as an RGB color value, it would be represented as <code>rgb(255, 102, 0)</code>. Once again, using the same <code>maroon</code> and <code>yellow</code> background colors previously used, is possible to represent them using RGB color values:<br>
<code>.task {<br>
background: rgb(128, 0, 0);<br>
}<br>
.count {<br>
background: rgb(255, 255, 0);<br>
}</code></p>

<p>An important feature of RGB color values is that it allows the introduction of a fourth parameter, known as alpha, or transparency channel, using the <code>rgba()</code> function, the values of the alpha channel range from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code> where <code>0</code> is a fully transparent color, and <code>1</code> is a fully opaque color. Any decimal value in between would create a semi-transparent color. As an example, if we wanted a shade of orange to appear 50% opaque, the RGBa color value to be used would be: <code>rgba(255, 102, 0, .5)</code>.</p>

<!-- 16.11.21 -->

<h4>HSL & HSLa colors</h4>

<p>The HSL color values are similar to the <code>rgb()</code> function, it stands for: <b>H</b>ue, <b>S</b>aturation, and <b>L</b>ightness, and in this order the <code>hsl()</code> function accepts three comma-separated values. The first value, the hue, is a unitless number from <code>0</code> to <code>360</code>. This numbers represent the color wheel, and the value identifies the degree of a color on the color wheel. The second and third values, saturation and lightness respectively, are percentages values from <code>0</code> to <code>100%</code>. The saturation values identifies how saturated with color the hue is, with <code>0%</code> being grayscale and <code>100%</code> being completely white. Coming back to the previous shade of orange, as an HSL color value it would be writeen as <code>hsl(24, 100%, 50%)</code>. The aforementioned <code>maroon</code> and <code>yellow</code> background colors can also be stated as HSL color values, as shown here:</p>

<p><code>.task {<br>
background: hsl(0, 100%, 25%);<br>
}<br>
.count {<br>
background: hsl(60, 100%, 50%);<br>
}</code></p>

<p>Just as the <code>rgba()</code> function the <code>hsla()</code> function accepts/includes an alpha parameter that identify the degree of opacity. The shade of orange previously seen with a 50% opacity, would be represented as an HSLa color value of <code>hsla(24, 100%, 50%, .5)</code>.</p>

<h3>lengths</h3>

<p>Similarly to colors, length values can be represented in a handful of ways, each of them serving a distinct purpose. But regardless of how is expressed, length values can refer to absolute or relative length, each of which uses different units of measurement.</p>

<h4>Absolute lengths</h4>

<p>These type of values are the simpliest length values, as they are attached to a physical unit measure, namely, <code>mm</code>, <code>in</code>, <code>cm</code>, etc. Thew most popular absolute unit of measure is the pixel (<code>px</code>). The pixel is equal to 1/96th of an inch; rougthly <code>4px</code> make up a <code>mm</code>, nevertheless, the exact measurement varies slightly between high-density and low-density viewing devices. A CSS font-size set up example would look like:<br>
<code>p {<br>
font-size: 14px;<br>
}</code></p>

<h4>Relative lengths</h4>

<p>Relative lengths are expressed in percentages, represented by the <code>%</code> notation, they rely on the length of another measurement, making them a little bit more complicated. For example, to set the <code>width</code> of an element to <code>50%</code>, is necessary to know the length of its parent element (the element it is nested within), and then identify <code>50%</code> of the parent element's width.<br>
<code>.col {<br>
width: 50%;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>The above CSS, in simple words means, set the width of the element with the class attribute of <code>col</code> to <code>50%</code>. That <code>50%</code> will be calculated relative to the width of the parent element. This percentages are extremely helpful for setting the height and width of elements and building out a web page's layout.</p>

<h5>Em</h5>

<p><code>Em</code> is a very popular relative unit of length, and refers to the (times of the) element's font-size. An single <code>em</code> (<code>1em</code>) is equivalent to one time the element's font-size. So, for example, if an element has a font size of <code>14px</code> and a <code>width</code> set to <code>5em</code>, the width would be equal to <code>14px x 5 = 70px</code>.<br>
<code>.banner {<br>
font-size: 14px;<br>
width: 5em;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>Keep in mind that when a font size is not explicitly stated for an element, the <code>em</code> unit will be relative/take the value of the font size of the closest parent element with a stated font size.</p>

<h1>The Box Model</h1>

<h3>The Display Property</h3>

<p>The way how exactly an element is displayed (as block-level, inline-level element or something else) is controlled by the <code>display</code> property. Every element has a default value for this property, which, as all other property values can be overwritten, being the most common: <code>block</code>, <code>inline</code>, <code>inline-block</code>, and <code>none</code>. For example, if the <code>display</code> property for a <code>&#60;p&#62;</code> element is going to be changed from <code>inline</code> to a <code>block</code> level/type display, the CSS would be the following:<br>
<code>p {<br>
display: block;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>The <code>inline-block</code> value, allows an element to behave as a <code>block</code> level element (allowing it to contain other elements) whilst being displayed in line with other elements, and without begining on a new line by default, e.g.:<br>
<code>p {<br>
display: inline-block;<br>
}</code></p>

<h4>Demo: display inline-block</h4>

<h5>HTML</h5>

<p><code>&#60;p&#62;Paragraph one.&#60;/p&#62;<br>
&#60;p&#62;Paragraph two.&#60;/p&#62;<br>
&#60;p&#62;Paragraph three.&#60;/p&#62;</code></p>

<h5>CSS</h5>

<p><code>p {<br>
display: inline-block;<br>
}</code></p>

<h5>Result</h5>

<p>Paragraph one. Paragraph two. Paragraph three.</p>

<p>Is important to make the distinction that inline-block elements will display an small gap/space between them, although sometimes annoying, this gap is completely normal and removable.</p>

<p>Lastly, a <code>display: none;</code> value will completely hide the element and its nested elements, redering the page as if that element doesn't exist, e.g.:<br>
<code>div {<br>
display: none;<br>
}</code></p>

<h2>What is the Box Model?</h2>

<p>The most important concept of the model is this:</p>

<h3><b>Every element on a page is a rectangular box.</b></h3>

<p><i>Even if it</i> looks <i>like a circle.</i></p>

<p>Therefore, <b>every</b> element will have: <b>a width</b>, <b>a height</b>, <b>a padding</b>, <b>borders</b>, <b>and margins</b>.</p>

<p>Each part of the model corresponds to a CSS property: <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>padding</code>, <code>border</code>, and <code>margin</code>, e.g.:<br>
<code>div {<br>
border: 6px solid #949599;<br>
height: 100px;<br>
margin: 20px;<br>
padding: 20px;<br>
width: 400px;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>Considering all the elements of the box model the total width can be determined using the following formula:<br>
<code>margin-right + border-right + padding-right + <b>width</b> + padding-left + border-left + margin-left</code></p>

<p>Anagously, the total height can be calculated as:<br>
<code>margin-top + border-top + padding-top + <b>height</b> + padding-bottom + border-bottom + margin-bottom</code>.</p>

<p>By default, <b>every</b> element has a width and height. These values may be just <code>0px</code>, but as long as it has a size, browsers will render it. Depending on how an element is displayed an its importance into the document layout, it may require specified <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> property values. In this case, the property values for non-inline elements may be specified.</p>

<h3>Width</h3>

<p>The <code>width</code> property is affected by the display property value, for instance, the block-level elements (<code>display: block;</code>) have a default width of <code>100%</code> consuming the entire horizonatal space available. Whilst inline-level elements must expand or contract to accommodate their content, thus the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties are only relevant to <strong>non-inline</strong> elements (e.g. block elements).</p>

<p><code>div {<br>
width: 400px;<br>
}</code></p>

<h3>Height</h3>

<p>By default the height of an element is set by its content unless stated otherwise. To set a specific height for a non-inline element, use the <code>height</code> property:<br>
<code>div {<br>
height: 100px;<br>
}</code></p>

<h4>The size of <b>inline-level</b> elements</h4>

<p>Is necessary to take into account that <b>inline-level</b> elements will not accept any <code>height</code> or <code>width</code> values attached to them. On the other hand, <b>block</b> and <b>inline-block</b> elements will.</p>

<h4>Margin & padding</h4>

<p>Depending on the element, a browser may apply different padding and margin values in order to aid with the legibility and clarity. As seen previously, is possible to use CSS resets to start with a blank canvas and work from the ground up to specify our own values.</p>

<h4>Margin</h4>

<p>The main margin's purpose is to set the amount of space that surrounds an element, it specifies a <i>breathing</i> room to help place an element, keeping any other element at a safe distance, from this point of view is like a barrier to another elements, and is completely transparent in color. Example:<br>
<code>div {<br>
margin: 20px;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>The <i>oddity</i> with the <code>margin</code> property is taht <b>vertical</b> margins, <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code>, are not accepted by <strong>inline-level</strong> elements. These vertical margins are, however, accepted by <strong>block-level</strong> and <strong>inline-block</strong> elements.</p>

<h4>Padding</h4>

<p>The <code>padding</code> property is very similar to the <code>margin</code> property with the difference that it falls inside an element's border, should an element have a border. The <code>padding</code> property <strong>is used to provide spacing directly within an elemnt</strong>. <i class="faq">What does this exaclty mean?</i> Here's an example:<br>
<code>div {<br>
padding: 20px;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>Unlike the <code>margin</code> property, the <code>padding</code> actually works in <strong>inline-level</strong> elements, could be blended into the upper and lower lines of the given element, but this vertical <code>padding</code> it will be displayed.</p>

<h5>Inline-level elements: margins and padding</h5>

<div>
<p>To summarize:</p>

<p>For <strong>blocks</strong> and <strong>inline-blocks</strong>, <b>all margins</b> and <b>paddings</b> work normally.</p>

<p>The elements to take into account in this aspect are the <strong>inline</strong> elements, whose:<br>
<strong>paddings:</strong> may blend with the upper and/or bottom lines of the given element, and work on <b>all four sides</b> and, its<br>
<strong>margins:</strong> works <b>only horizontally</b> and are <b>transparent</b> in color.</p>
</div>

<h4>How to state/declare margins and paddings</h4>

<p>When writting CSS, many of the property values can be stated/declared one after the other in a longhand way, in which for each parameter has its own property stated. The other alternative is abbreviate this property value declaration and state each value in an specific order avoiding state each parameter property explicitly (shorthand), however, not all properties have a shorthand notation/alternative, therefore is necessary to make sure the correct property+value structure is used.</p>

<p>For the property at hand <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code> they both come in longhand and shorthand form. For the <code>margin</code> a single value of this property is the shorthand declaration for all four sides of the same length. Example:<br>
<code>div {<br>
margin: 20px;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>Again, in the <code>margin</code> property, when only two values are stated, the first one belongs to the <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code> margin values respectively. In the following example, a <code>10px top</code> and <code>bottom</code> margins are set up, and a <code>20px left</code> and <code>right</code> margin is being declared:<br>
<code>div {<br>
margin: 10px 20px;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>If specify unique values for each side is desired, is necessary state four values that scan the element's margin in a clockwise position from <code>top</code>, to <code>right</code>, to <code>bottom</code>, to <code>left</code>. In this example margins of <code>10px</code> at the <code>top</code>, <code>20px</code> at the <code>right</code>, <code>0px</code> at the <code>bottom</code>, and <code>15px</code> on the <code>left</code> of a <code>&#60;div&#62;</code> element are being placed:<br>
<code>div {<br>
margin: 10px 20px 0 15px;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>In the case of the <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code> with longhand, it is possible to state the value for one side at a time using unique properties, they are followed by a dash and the side of the box to which the value is to be applied, for example: <code>padding-left</code>, <code>margin-top</code> etc, all of these accepting only one value.<br>
<code>div {<br>
margin-top: 10px;<br>
padding-left: 6px;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>Longhand declarations help to keep the code clear in intentions, although when dealing with more values shorthand declarations becomes handy.</p>

<!-- 16.11.21-lor:038-000 - 16.11.22 -->
<!-- 16.11.22 -->

<p>Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended to use longhand properties when declaring a single value for the <code>margin</code>, <code>padding</code> and other properties. For example, did we really want to set the <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>left</code> sides of the element to a unique value, let's say <code>0px</code>? Or did we mean only to be the <code>bottom</code> margin?.</p>

<h5>Margin & Padding Colors</h5>

<p>Keep in mind that the <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code> <b>do NOT</b> accept color values, as the are completely transparent <i class="faq">&mdash;the one in between, the border, it does?&mdash;</i>. This transparent nature means they will show their respective background colors. In the case of the <code><b>margin</b></code> will be the parent's element color. And in the case of the <code><b>padding</b></code> the color of the element itself (the background color of the element that <code>padding</code> is applied to).</p>

<h3>Borders</h3>

<p>Border is the space tha fall inbetween the <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code> and provide an outline around that element. They comprehend three parameters: <code>width</code>, <code>style</code>, and <code>color</code>. Shortand values for these properties must be stated in this way. In longhand, these three values can be broken up into: <code>border-width</code>, <code>border-style</code>, <code>border-color</code> properties. These longhand properties are useful for changing, or overwriting a single border value.</p>

<p>Also, borders can have different apperances. The most common styles values are but not limited to: <code>solid</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>dashed</code>, <code>dotted</code>, and <code>none</code>. Here is an example of a border that wraps around a <code>&#60;div&#62;</code> element (because there's no side indicated) with a <code>6px width</code>, in <code>solid style</code>, and <code>grey style</code>:<br>
<code>div {<br>
border: 6px solid #949599;<br>
}<br></code></p>

<!-- 16.11.22-lor:044-038 -->
<!-- 16.11.23-lor:044-053 -->

<h3>Individual border sides</h3>

<p>As with the <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code> properties, borders' properties can be handled on one side of an element at a time. Doing so, demands the definition of properties for each sides, namely: <code>border-top</code>, <code>border-right</code>, <code>border-bottom</code>, and <code>border-left</code>. The same as in <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code> properties, the values for this properties are: <code>width</code>, <code>style</code>, and <code>color</code>. If we want, we can make a border appear only on the bottom of an element:</p>

<p><code>div {<br>
border-bottom: 6px solid #949599;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>Additionally, the styles for individual border sides may be controlled at an even finer level. For example, if we wish to change only the <code>width</code> of the bottom border we can use the following code:<br>
<code>div {<br>
border-bottom-width: 12px;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>The structure to state these properties is: <code>border-side-property</code>, where <code>side</code> refers to: <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code>, or <code>left</code>; and <code>property</code> refers to: <code>width</code>, <code>style</code>, or <code>color</code>.</p>

<h4>Border Radius</h4>

<p>Within the border properties the one that allow round the corners of an element is the <code>border-radius</code>, including percentages and pixels, that identify the radius by which the corners of an element are to be rounded. If:<br>
A single value is stated: all corners will be rounded equally.<br>
Two values are stated: the <code>top-left</code>/<code>bottom-right</code> will be rounded in that order.<br>
Four values will round the <code>top-left</code>, <code>top-right</code>, <code>bottom-right</code>, and <code>bottom-left</code> corners in that order.</p>

<!-- 16.11.24-lor: 053-059 -->

<p>The following is an example of a detailed use for the border radius of an element:<br>
<code>div {<br>
border-top-right-radius: 5px;<br>
}</code></p>

<h3>Box sizing</h3>

<p>Previously, was discussed that the box sizing was an additive characteristic. For example, if the <code>width</code> of an element is set to <code>500px</code> with a <code>20px padding</code> and a <code>10px border</code>, the actual <code>width</code> of the element is <code>560px</code>. However, CSS3 introduced an additional way to support box-sizing into the box model, which allows change exactly how the box model works and how the element's size is calculated. This property allows three different primary values or configurations &mdash;<code>content-box</code>, <code>padding-box</code>, and <code>border-box</code>&mdash;each of which has a slightly different impact on how the box size is calculated.</p>

<h4>Content box</h4>

<p>This is the default value/parameter and is the one previously discussed. The model starts with the <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> adding from these any <code>padding</code>, <code>border</code>, or <code>margin</code>.</p>

<code>div {<br>
-webkit-box-sizing: content-box;<br>
-moz-box-sizing: content-box;<br>
box-sizing: content-box;<br>
}<br>
<i>-webkit, -moz, and -ms are vendor prefixes to help with backwards compatibility with older browsers.</i></code>

<h4>Padding box</h4>

<p>This property value alters the box model keeping constant the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> of the element, and porportionally shrinking the content holded by it depending on the set padding size. Any stated value for the <code>margin</code> or <code>border</code> will be added to the element's total size. Coming back to the previous example, if an element has a <code>400px width</code>, a <code>20px padding</code>, and <code>10px border</code> the total size of the element will be <code>420px</code> (<code>padding</code> already included, 400px width + 10px left-border + 10px right-border)</p>

<code>div {<br>
box-sizing: padding-box;<br>
}</code>

<!-- 16.11.25 -->

<h4>Border box</h4>

<p>Lastly, the <code>border-box</code> value, includes any <code>padding</code>, and/or <code>border</code> into the element's <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. For example, if an element has a <code>400px width</code> a <code>20px padding</code>, and a <code>10px border</code> the total <code>width</code> of the element will still be <code>400px</code>.<br>
<code>div {<br>
box-sizing: border-box;<br>
}</code></p>

<p>However, regardless of the box-model used, any <code>margin</code> included for the element must be added to get the final size of the element. Therefore, if in the previous example, a <code>30px margin</code> was used, the final <code>width</code> of the elements will be: <code>460px = margin-left: 30px + width: 400px + margin-right: 30px;</code>.</p>

<h4>Picking a box size</h4>

<p>Generally speaking, is <code>border-box</code> value is preferred, this makes our math much, much easier, if an element is set to be let's say <code>500px</code> wide is going to remain the same size regardless of what padding or border values are added to it.</p>

<p>Additionally, it makes easier to use/mix different length units, let's say an element is <code>40%</code> wide, with a <code>padding: 20px;</code> and a <code>border: 10px;</code> these units can be mixed without any issue, and is possible to still guarantee that the actual <code>width</code> of the box will remain <code>40%</code>. As this property was introduced in CSS3, its only drawback is backwards compatibility with older browsers, although this problem is becoming less and less relevant as new browser versions start to include this features. Should we notice any rendering issue, it's worth looking into which browser those issures are occuring with.</p>

<h1>Positioning Content</h1>

<p>One of the most important features of CSS is the possibility to place content in almost any desired way, bringing structure to the document and making the content more digestible. There are different options to do this, each with its own application, allowing the creation of reusable layouts and uniquely positioning one&ndash;off elements.</p>

<!-- 16.11.26 -->

<h2>Positioning with floats</h2>

<p>A very useful way to position element is with the <code>float</code> property, this feature, allow us to take an element, and remove it from the normal flow of the page, and position it next to its parent element (either in its left or right). All other elements on the page will then flow around the floated element. For example and <code>&#60;img&#62;</code> element floated to the side of a few paragraphs of text, will allow these paragraphs to wrap around the image as necessary.</p>

<p>When the <code>float</code> property is used on multiple elements at the same time, it provides the ability to create a layout by floating elements directly to or opposite each other, as seen in multiple-column layouts. <i class="faq">What exaclty this means? examples of this?</i>. The <code>float</code> property accepts a few values, being the most popular <code>left</code> and <code>right</code><br>
<code>img {<br>
float: left;<br>
}</code></p>

<h3>Floats in practice <i class="review">add link to another page with solved example</i></h3>

<p>In a common page layout with a header, two columns in the center, and a footer at the bottom, the elements would look like this:</p>

<section class="code-example">
  <header><code class="float-example">&#60;header&#62;</code></header>
  <section><code class="float-example">&#60;section&#62;</code></section>
  <aside><code class="float-example">&#60;aside&#62;</code></aside>
  <footer><code class="float-example">&#60;footer&#62;</code></footer>
</section>
